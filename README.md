### Code ###
For homework tonight, please complete the following code challenge. Please use Kotlin and MVVM :D

Make an Urban Dictionary app.

* DO NOT force unwrap your code or show signs of forced unwrapping your code.
* Include a text input for users to enter the term they wish to search.
* Show the list of resulting definitions, with number of thumbs up and thumbs down votes. Use a RecyclerView for this list.
* Allow users to sort by either most thumbs up or down.
* Show a progress indication while the Urban Dictionary API call is being made.
* Document all assumptions.

Use the API as described here: https://market.mashape.com/community/urban-dictionary.

While this is a toy project and not a professional product, take care to demonstrate your ability to architect clean, maintainable and self-documenting code.

Feel free to add any functionality and refinements that you feel would showcase your abilities. Some ideas:

* Save instance state.
* Handle configuration changes gracefully.
* Cache results for limited offline operation.
* UI design, if that is a strength.
* Dependency injection.
